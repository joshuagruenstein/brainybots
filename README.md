#### Website

The website is using a forked version of the [jemdoc+markdown](http://www.mit.edu/~wsshin/jemdoc+mathjax.html) Python static site generator, with modifications to support subdirectories.  To build, run `python3 build.py` in the website directory, which will generate a static site in `website/build`.
